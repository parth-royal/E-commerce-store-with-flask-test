# E-commerce-store-with-flask-test

Structure: The code uses Flask for routing, Jinja2 for templating, and in-memory dictionaries for user data and cart management.
Authentication: The login-submit route handles user login and creates a session cookie. The logout route removes the session cookie. The logged_in variable keeps track of the user's login status.
Cart Functionality: The add-to-cart route handles adding items to the cart. The cart dictionary stores items in the cart.
HTML Templates: Each route uses a corresponding HTML template to display content.
